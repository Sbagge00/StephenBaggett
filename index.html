                         <p style="padding-right:70px;">
                             Monsters, combat, damage, hit points, spells, weapon attacks; these take up over a fourth of the rules of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The player’s handbook lays out rules for combat and gives some monster stats, the Dungeon Master’s Guide explains how to make and run monsters, and there is a whole book devoted to just monsters in the appropriately named Monster Manual. Combat is at the heart of what makes Dungeons &amp; Dragons…well, Dungeons &amp; Dragons. It’s in the name! It’s not called “Dungeons &amp; oh by the way, you don’t get to fight any Dragons”. Of course, it can be a stage for memorable role-playing and yes, it has amazing tools for building deadly dungeons, cruel traps and mind-boggling puzzles that the players can (and should always be able to) overcome. But at the core of how Dungeons & Dragons works as a game, is built into the combat. Spells have rules for how long they are and how many enemies you can affect because it’s mostly built for the context of being used in a battle. A ton of class features would be completely useless (maybe even whole classes) if that character never encountered a band of orcs or a roaming wyvern.<br>
                            <br>
                             So, if combat is at the heart of this game, how do we go about running encounters? Now, obviously the rules can tell you how initiative works and how to figure out your bonus to hit and spell saves but that’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about how to narrate the action that happens within combat encounters. More importantly, using that narration to empower your players in a way that makes combat exhilarating for them. And for those that rather would rather roleplay, making combat (hopefully) bearable or even enjoyable for them.<br>
                            <br>
                             Recently, I was going through some of my old belongings and stumbled across something that I hadn’t watched in years. It was a DVD of the 2003 Cartoon Network TV series, "Star Wars: Clone Wars" (not to be confused with the movie and tv series by the same name that started in 2008). This show, hands down, had the best actions scenes. After doing some research I learned that the genius behind it, Genndy Tartakovsky also worked on other cartoons such as Samurai Jack. The animation style that he was well known for was just so punchy and the combat always had captivated as a kid and as an adult. There was one scene (video below), where a clone trooper, Captain Fordo took down battle droid after battle droid, covering his teammates as they retreated. That has to be one of the most epic moments in cartoon animation. Re-watching this action-packed series made me wonder. Why can’t D&D combat be like this? I always loved working on creating fun encounters for my players but after a while, it lost its luster. Both my players and I got bored. It had lost its punchiness.<br>
                            <br>

							<br>
							<br>
                             Hit points (stick with me here). There’s something really special about them. For most people, whenever you get slashed, stabbed or bludgeoned, you lose hit points. But what if taking damage wasn’t always the player getting stabbed or bloody. Or vice versa, what if missing isn’t always “missing”? Let me give you an example. Jarrod the Elven Fighter and his companions come across a gang of trolls. These trolls are nasty and could possibly wipe the party. The trolls were able to surprise the party, and the leader of the gang, a two-headed creature called an Ettin goes to attack Jarrod. A 19 to hit plus 7 with its Morningstar. “Yeah, that hits” he says. “But did it?” Now, of course a 26 is way over the Elf’s armor class but I wanted to try something. The Elven Fighter had with him a shield. I describe that as the huge Morningstar comes down on him, he lifts up his shield at the last second. “WHAM” the Morningstar slams into his shield and with all his might he is able to keep his shield up. I describe that the impact reverberates throughout his body. A sharp pain in his shoulder tells him he just dislocated it. “You take 12 points of damage”. Now the Morningstar never made contact with him, it never drew any blood. I think this style of narrating hits and misses opens up combat to be more of a narrative experience that I players can enjoy being a part of. <br>
							<br>
							The Ettin has been slain along with two of the trolls. One remains. The party is battered and one of them is already retreating. The Ranger, standing his ground, pulls back one his bow to shoot. He is pretty high level and so he gets two attacks per turn. Both hit and do close to max damage. I say, “As you pull back, you try a technique you learned recently, and attempt to shoot both arrows at the same time.” I narrate that as he releases, both arrows fly into each of the eye sockets of the remaining troll. Now, by the rules that’s not how having an extra attack technically work. They are two distinct attacks that you roll for separately. But the reaction I got as both arrows sunk into the eye as the troll now blinded, brought excitement back into combat. After that battle, whenever the player would make two attacks with his bow, he would ask, “Do I shoot both arrows at the same time again?”. His excitement was contagious to the rest of the party. It gave them the freedom to use the rules in a way that they hadn’t thought about before.<br>
							<br>
							Now, I’m not saying to narrate every single action that every character and monster makes. I think that would be tedious and would really slow down combat. I don’t want that and I don’t think your players do either. I would love to write about some of my ideas for making combat efficient and easy to run but that’s for another time. Ultimately, I think finding moments where you can allow the players to be creative and engage with the narrative of combat can make combat much more enjoyable.

                             Winter. It was a cold winter. <br>
                             People were freezing. <br>
                             <br>
                             Open fires flickered late into the night and huddled masses prayed. <br>
                             They prayed for deliverance from the wind kell. <br>
                             <br>
                             The next day we ran out of food. <br>
                             People were dying. <br>
                             She was dying. <br>
                             <br>

                             She was my rose. <br>
                             I found her. She looked on me with eyes of the wolf kell. <br>
                             “Little rose” I said. “I will teach you to live”. <br>
                             From that day she called me <i>Ash’ku</i> <br>
                             <br>
                             The next day she was bedridden. <br>
                             Breathing but those wolf eyes shut. <br>
                             <br>
                             I killed a man. His blood still on my clothes. <br>
                             I think he was my brother. <br>
                             But then she eats a little of the bread I stole. <br>
                             <i>“Ash’ku”</i> she calls out to me. <br>
                             I do not let her see the face of a murderer. <br>

                             The next day my stomach stops hurting. <br>
                             Again, you appear, seeing my rose. <br>
                             You say you can help. <br>
                             I try to kill you. <br>

                             The last day my rose stops talking. <br>
                             Lights appear in the sky. <br>
                             You ask for my rose. <br>
                             Too weak. My body feels strange. I surrender. <br>
                             You say you can save her. <br>
                             <br>

                             About the writing. This is some writing I did for one of my campaigns I am planning.
                             The story is of an Ash'ku (father) who is desperately trying to take care of his adopted daughter.
                             Life on the planet TH-283 (called "Xeres" by the inhabitants) is often harsh. It's a barren windswept place full
                             of canyons, blue deserts, and giant crawlers. The story focuses on a long winter that hit the planet in the year 2940.
                             The aforementioned "you" refers to a human man who was from the nearby gas giant of TH-832 ALPHA who was on an expedition to
                             find natural resources to be harvested from Xeres. It is unknown what become of the Xerian child named "Rose".
                             Only that the tale was precautionary in nature against off-worlders.

                             My plan is let my players find this tale, thereby introducing them to the alien species.
